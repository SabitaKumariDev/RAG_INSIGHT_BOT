User: what is fs module?
Assistant: The fs module is a built-in Node.js module that provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. You can load it using require('fs'). An example of using the fs module is:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

fs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'I live in Philadelphia')
```

This script writes a message to notes.txt. After you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and you’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”.
